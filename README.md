# Soldering Projects
Unfortuantly, most of my "projects" aren't really projects. Most have been various repairs on everyday items, like replacing a faulty battery charger on an old 3ds or the plug for a vehicle trailer's lights. But there has been one consistent project I've been pursuing for several years now called the MintyPi.

###The Mintypi
The Mintypi is an DIY emultor system that runs off of a RaspberryPi Zero W. But what's so special about it? Well, it's main point of interest is that the entire system is crammed into an Altoids mint tin. This project was designed by a software developer who goes by the alias Wermy and runs an online company called [Sudomod](https://sudomod.com). Wermy has made several iterations of these devices, with each new model boasting more features than the last. He offer guides on how to build them, as well as offers some of the parts required in his shop.
