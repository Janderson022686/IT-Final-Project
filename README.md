# Soldering Projects
Unfortuantly, most of my "projects" aren't really projects. Most have been various repairs on everyday items, like replacing a faulty battery charger on an old 3ds or the plug for a vehicle trailer's lights. But there has been one consistent project I've been pursuing for several years now called the MintyPi.

###The Mintypi
The Mintypi is an DIY emultor system that runs off of a RaspberryPi Zero W. But what's so special about it? Well, it's main point of interest is that the entire system is crammed into an Altoids mint tin. This project was designed by a software developer who goes by the alias Wermy and runs an online company called [Sudomod](https://sudomod.com). Wermy has made several iterations of these devices, with each new model boasting more features than the last. He offer guides on how to build them, as well as offers some of the parts required in his shop.

I have built three of these so far, each a different model. All three of them do work well, but the process of building them is quite a headache and takes a good chunk of time as well (not to mention the cost, as they are suprisingly expensive too). I'm most proud of my most recent one, model 3.5, as the solder work in it is some of my best and it overall looks the cleanest of the bunch. It also includes the latest software, which actully allows it to handle PS1 games (A rather impressive feat for a mint tin). Below is an image of the three I have completed, which are model versions 2, 3.5, and Lite (from left to right).
