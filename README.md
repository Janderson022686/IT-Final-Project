# About Myself
My name is Jordan, although I commonly traverse the internet under the username Anerjed. I've lived in Missouri all of my life, and I'm currently studying at the University of Missouri. At this time I haven't declared a major for myself quite yet, but I do hold a particular interest in the field of Psychiatry. I currently work as a technician at a local pharmacy, and in my free time I enjoy gaming and working with electronics.
