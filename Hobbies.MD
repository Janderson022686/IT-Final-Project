# Hobbies

The majority of my personal hobbies are geared towards electronics, which have always played an important role in my life. I also tend to enjoy constructing things, as I find it satisfying to put something together and see it function. 

### Gaming
Perhaps my biggest hobby is playing games, which have always meant a lot to me since childhood. Growing up, I played a lot of Nintendo with my siblings and formed a lot of good memories with them. These days, while I still enjoy consoles, I'm much more PC gaming-oriented and spend a lot of time on Steam. I think my favorite genres will always be platforming and puzzle-solving, although I do enjoy survival and fps games as well. And pretty much anything made by Valve is a classic for me. I recently managed to get my hands on a Valve Index, so I've been exploring a lot of the VR field as well.

### Electronics and Soldering
I've always enjoyed working with electronics, especially when putting together new systems. I build my first PC in my sophomore year of high school, and it still reigns as one of my favorite things I've worked on. I still use it today, although I am in the process of designing a new one as my current is a bit outdated, it can barely handle some of today's newer games (especially VR titles). I also find a lot of joy in soldering and have worked on a few projects involving it, my favorite of which would have to be the MintyPi. I go more in-depth on that on my Soldering Projects page. 

### Percussion
While  I really haven't practiced since high school, I've been a percussionist for a lot of my life. I started off primarily with the snare drum but eventually spread out to other instruments in the field as well, of which my favorites include:

- Drum Kit
- Temple Blocks
- Crash Cymbal
- Xylophone (Albeit I'm quite rudimentary at it)
